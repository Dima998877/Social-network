# Social-network


Project Description:
React.js Social Network
This is a single-page application that allows server requests such as GET, POST, and DELETE to interact with the backend.
To handle the application state, I utilize Redux as a state management library.
It's not a ready app, it's my playground where I'm studying React's libraries and exploring different approaches.

Tech stack: Node.js, React.js, CRA, Redux, Redux-thunk, Axios, JS, HTML, CSS
